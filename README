[ctrleff-backend - backend for ctrleff, powered by Flask, with Python]

ctrl-EFF
--------

ctrl-EFF (Control-F) is a location-based experience bookmarking service. It is a startup conceived to solve the very problem of answering the question: "What should I do next?". We answer this question with the help of the social network effect with Checkpoints. Checkpoints are captured experiences that tells you what an experience is, where it is, and what your friends think about it.
